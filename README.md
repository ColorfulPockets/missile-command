## Proposal
We will recreate the Atari game called Missile Command but with a twist. The game involves missiles falling from the sky and the player must blow up the missiles in the air before they make contact with the ground. Instead of having the player use the cursor to aim at the missiles, we plan to have each missile correspond to a letter and the player must type that letter to blow up that missile. To make sure they don't just randomly type letters, we plan to incorporate a cool down timer after each letter is typed. In addition, instead of mutliple levels, we plan to make it an endless game with scaling difficulty. We will display various information to the player such as score and their cool down timer. We want to add cool animations and unique game play elements such as different missile types, power ups, and the like.
